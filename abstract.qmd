## Introduction

Social media platforms such as Instagram offer users a way to reach wide audiences, and as such, many users and businesses aim to increase engagement on the platform. One key component of engagement is maximizing the number of likes a post receives relative to the number of followers the user has. One aspect of Instagram users and businesses have control over is the time of day at which they post. This begs the research question, does the hour of day at which an Instagram post is published affect its engagement, and what other factors are correlated with engagement? Other factors investigated include the type of post (carousel with multiple images or video post), if the post was published on a weekend, caption characterestics including length and the presence of hashtags or mentions in the caption, and account characteristics like follower count and following count.

The data used is a sample of over 8,000 public Instagram posts posted between September 2011 and February 2024 posted by 931 users across the world. Each observation is a single post, the number of likes it received, the number of users following and followed by the post's associated account at the time of posting, the account's username, the post's caption, the post's location if one was added, the time stamp at which the post was published, and if the post was a carousel (multiple images in one post) or a video. The data was obtained from Kaggle and originally scraped from Instagram

The data cleaning involved making several new variables to use as predictors for engagement. Based on the timestamps, a binary indicator indicating if the post was published on a weekend and a variable representing the hour of day the post was published were created (the baselines are not on a weekend and posted between 12 and 1 am). Based on the caption, the number of characters in the caption and binary indicators if the caption contained hashtags or user mentions were added (the baselines are no hashtags and no mentions). The variables indicating if a post was a video or if a post was a carousel were converted to factors.
